# suicapydc

(Nov 6, 2023): I rewrote SUICA again so I'm archiving this repo. Visit https://github.com/igouProto/suicapydcV3 to meet the new Suica!


A discord bot packed with music playback and some other features.
<br>Written in Python based on discord.py rewrite. Specifically coded for hosting on Heroku.
<br>Named after Ibuki Suika from the Touhou Project series.
<br>Most of the respond that will be sent by the bot is hardcoded and is in Traditional Chinese.
<p>
  Suica the bot is not yet ready for public installation as a lot of administrative functions are not implemented. The main purpose of this project is to push myself to learn programming with Python and I'm sure that I still got A WHOLE LOT to learn.
